# Find Your Famous Version
Hello everyone, I've always wondered how casting agencies do the casting for a scene where a certain actor is young or old for a movie or TV show. I respect the art of make-up, but I am one of those who think that a different actor should play in that scene.

If we look at the developments in computer vision in recent years, there will be no need for make-up in such cases. I think that face swapping and similar approaches will make great contributions to the cinema industry in this field.

In this project, we will take a look at the problem of casting agencies, which is the first thing I wonder about. We will have an open source celeba dataset of celebrities. We will find the face closest to the face we have given as input from this dataset.
